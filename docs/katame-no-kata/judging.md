# Katame-no-kata

::: details IJF Competition Criteria
The evaluation of every technique of kata has to consider the principle and the
opportunity of execution: the evaluation (including the opening and closing ceremony)
has to be comprehensive.

At the invitation of the central judge, Tori and Uke advance through the safety zone
along the competition area. They move towards the axis of the kata (not evaluated).
At the end of the kata, after bowing to each other in front of the competition area, Tori
and Uke turn their backs to the judges and walk outside the tatami where they entered
and leave the tatami (not evaluated).

The opening ceremony begins at the 8m or 10m line. The following are included in the
opening ceremony: bowing to competition mat, stepping left / right foot, bowing to
judges, and bowing to partner, and stepping left / right foot for the first technique.
The closing ceremony begins when Tori and Uke finish the last technique, and includes
stepping behind the 6m line, bowing to partner, bowing to judges and exiting (starting
with the right foot) to the safety zone at 8 m or 10 m, bowing to the competition mat.
Each technique ends when Tori releases the technique; errors which subsequently
occur are included in the next technique.

For Katame-no-Kata, the technique ends when Tori assumes the kyoshi posture.
Each technique must be performed correctly and evaluated globally on the following
criteria:
- Set up
- Break of balance / Control
- Conclusion
- Efficiency
- Realism
- Fluidity

Any behaviour contrary to the spirit of judo will result in disqualification.

If any items are incorrect or missing, penalize according to the types of errors listed
below.

#### Forgotten technique / Major mistake
__Score = 0 Total final score divided in 1/2__

Situations
- Tori doesn’t do the appropriate technique following Uke’s attack.

attack or technique.

At the beginning, Tori and Uke stand upright facing each other in a distance of about 5.5m, while Tori
stands on the left side and Uke on the right side toward Shomen. Both turn to Shomen to make standing
bows simultaneously and turn face each other to make seated bows.

Then, after rising together, both Tori and Uke simultaneously take one step forward from their left feet to
take Shizen-hontai. Both simultaneously take one step backward with their left feet, kneel down on their
left knees on the previous spots of their left heels while keeping their left toes raise. Both move to slide
their right feet to their right sides (the lower leg at about 90° with the thigh) and put their right palms on
their right knees while resting their left hands naturally down. This posture is called Kyoshi or Kurai-dori.

Then, Uke moves his right foot to the inner side, takes one step forward with his right foot following on his
left knee (Shikko) and move to slides his right foot to his right side again to take the posture of Kyoshi.

## Osae-waza

### General

- Ensure consistency with the criteria and description of escapes and defence.
- Tori and Uke must aim to escape and defend with precision and accurate action 
reaction timing.
- Uke must clearly demonstrate each escape attempt. For this purpose, uki has
to always:
    - create space to perform the escape;
    - use hip mobility, bridging, and shrimping to effectively demonstrate escape
attempt; and,
    - effectively use angles.
- For the effective execution of osae waza it is very important for tori to control
uke’s movement prior to escaping or counter-attacking. For this purpose tori
has to always:
    - keep their body as low as possible;
    - when switching hips, slide knee low to maintain contact with the mat;
    - control uke’s neck all the time so as to prevent them from utilizing their head to escape;
    - maintain body to body contact;
    - utilize the strength of their whole body; and,
    - move a little faster than uke’s escape movement.
