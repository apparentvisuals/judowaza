It was created by Jigaro Kano to help judo students understand the principles and master the basic techniques of nage waza used in randori. It is made up of three representative techniques selected from te-waza, koshi-waza, ashi-waza, ma-sutemi-waza, and yoko-sutemi-waza to practice both left and right sides in each technique. Basis of throwing techniques is acquired by practice of kuzushi (breaking of balance), tsukuri (set up to execute the technique), kake (execution of the technique), and how to receive the technique. </p></section><section data-v-159340bf><h2 data-v-159340bf>Study Links</h2><p data-v-159340bf><a href="http://kodokanjudoinstitute.org/en/waza/forms/textbook/" data-v-159340bf> Kodokan Textbook </a></p><p data-v-159340bf><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HpFXUKxcDw" data-v-159340bf> Kodokan Teaching Video </a></p><p data-v-159340bf><a href="http://99e89a50309ad79ff91d-082b8fd5551e97bc65e327988b444396.r14.cf3.rackcdn.com/up/2018/12/IJF_KATA_EVALUATION_Jan_2019_R-1544176741.pdf" data-v-159340bf> IJF Kata 2019 Competition Rules </a></p><p data-v-159340bf><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-o3uzfj2aQ" data-v-159340bf> World Judo Kata Champions </a></p><p data-v-159340bf><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjVlgXP0adQ" data-v-159340bf> Kosei Inuoe Demonstration </a></p><p data-v-159340bf><a href="https://judoinfo.com/katanage/" data-v-159340bf>Forms of Throwing Summary</a></p></section><section data-v-159340bf><h2 data-v-159340bf>Key Points</h2><table class="key-points border border-collapse table-auto w-full" data-v-159340bf><tbody data-v-159340bf><tr data-v-159340bf><th data-v-159340bf>General Principles</th><td data-v-159340bf><ul data-v-159340bf><li data-v-159340bf>Demonstrate confidence (spirit) and control.</li><li data-v-159340bf> Memorize the order of kata so that attention can be focused on the details. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Kata should be performed smoothly without unnecessary movements. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Unless uke is striking, tsugi ashi is the form of walking (except tomoe nage). </li><li data-v-159340bf> Uke initiates grip or attack, but tori should always lead the movement. </li></ul></td></tr><tr data-v-159340bf><th data-v-159340bf>Uke</th><td data-v-159340bf><ul data-v-159340bf><li data-v-159340bf> Uke must really aim to strike the tento (forehead), with conviction. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Uke must learn how to breakfall properly, both laying down and rolling up. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Uke maintains a straight, strong body during the throw and in breakfall. </li><li data-v-159340bf> All throws are throws, there is no need for uke to ever jump. </li></ul></td></tr><tr data-v-159340bf><th data-v-159340bf>Tori</th><td data-v-159340bf><ul data-v-159340bf><li data-v-159340bf> Demonstrate kuzushi, tsukuri and kake in all throws, key transferable skills. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Kuzushi: Demonstrate the off balancing by showing uke at an angle. </li><li data-v-159340bf> Tsukuri: Get under uke\u2019s centre of gravity.

Walk through the kata for practice or warm-up to help train your body and mind. </li><li data-v-377ed4b5> Attend kata clinics to learn from different instructors. Each instructor will have their own teaching method and \u201Cflare\u201D to their kata that you can learn from. </li><li data-v-377ed4b5> Watch kata videos or read kata teaching manuals. By watching both the Kodokan video and videos of world level competitors you can learn tips and details to help you improve. </li><li data-v-377ed4b5> Video tape your kata and review it for critical self-reflection.

This not only is for practice but also will improve your representation of yourself and your dojo. For more information on Judo and Rei as described by the Kodokan click here. </li><li data-v-377ed4b5> Participate in kata tournaments, not to win but to learn. While winning gets you points towards your black belt and medals, learning stays with you your entire life \u2013 that is more valuable.
